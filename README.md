# address-finder

### Description
Used to search for a set of provided addresses by iterating over many possible standard and non-standard address derivation paths.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coreyphillips/address-finder
cd address-finder
yarn install
````
Once installed, open `index.js` and:
 - Replace the `MNEMONIC` variable with the mnemonic you would like to test.
 - Replace the addresses in the `ADDRESSES_TO_SEARCH_FOR` variable with the addresses you would like the program to search for.
 - `50` addresses per path are generated by default, but can be adjusted by changing the `MAX_INDEX_COUNT` variable.

Then run:
```bash
node .
````

If matches are found you will be greeted with something resembling the following response:
```
Mnemonic:
pyramid sport hunt mushroom hope jewel mountain sniff damage lunch mule inch
